        <h1>Call of Duty Warzone: Surviving the Final Circle</h1>
        <p>The final circle in Call of Duty Warzone is a true test of skill and strategy. Firstly, positioning is crucial—always aim to get to high ground or a well-covered spot. Keep an eye on the shrinking gas circle and plan your movements accordingly. Loadouts matter too; ensure you have a balance of weapons that suit close-quarters combat. Communication with your squad is key—coordinate your movements and share resources like armor plates and ammunition. Lastly, stay calm and patient. The final moments can be intense, but maintaining your composure will give you an edge over panicking opponents. With these tips in mind, you'll have a better chance of claiming victory in the final circle.</p>
